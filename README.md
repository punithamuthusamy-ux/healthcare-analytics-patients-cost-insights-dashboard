## 📈 8. Visual Insights & Analysis

### 🍃 8.1 Cancer Status (Smoker vs Non-Smoker)

* **Smokers : 405**
* **Non-Smokers : 1922**

🔍 *Smoking population forms a major high-risk category for cancer & chronic disease evaluation.*

---

### ⚖️ 8.2 Charges by Weight Status

## 💡 9. Insights (Business & Clinical Strategy)

### 📊 Descriptive

✔ Majority of population is **non-smoker**, but smokers still form a major risk group
✔ Obesity strongly correlates with high hospital expenditure
✔ Diabetes severity significantly increases annual healthcare cost
✔ Tier-2 hospitals attract higher-risk, high-cost patients

### 🔍 Diagnostic

⚠ Obesity & Diabetes are largest contributors to healthcare cost
⚠ Tier-2 hospital charges indicate complex case load
⚠ Smokers require targeted cancer-prevention counselling

### 🔮 Predictive

📈 Diabetes & obesity-driven costs will continue rising
🏥 Tier-2 hospitals will remain primary cost centres
📉 Early intervention can reduce long-term costs

### 📝 Prescriptive

* 🚑 Enhance **preventive care programs** for diabetic & obese patients
* 🩺 Implement **smoking cessation programs**
* 🏥 Optimise resource allocation for Tier-2 hospitals
* 💳 Introduce **risk-based insurance pricing** models

---

## 🔚 10. Conclusion

✔ Built a **complete Excel Healthcare Analytics Dashboard**
